# CS50 2019
## Harvard University introduction to Computer Science

I took cs50 in 2019 and learned to think algorithmically and solve programming problems efficiently. I completed all the 9 problem sets and learned to program in the following languages:
- C
- Python
- Lua
- HTML, CSS
- JavaScript
- SQL
