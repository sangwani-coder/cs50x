I took CS50 in 2019 and learned to think algorithmically and solve programming problems efficiently. I completed all the 9 problem sets and learned to program in the following languages:
- C
- Python
- Lua
- HTML, CSS
- JavaScript
- SQL

|Topic | Problem set files | Description |
|-------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| Scratch | [Problem set 0](./pset0) | Programming in Scratch |
| C | [Problem set 1](./pset1/) | Programming in the **C** (Data Types, Conditional Statements, Loops, Operators, Command Line)|
| Arrays | [Problem set 2](./pset2/) | Programming in **C** (Arrays, Functions, Variables and Scope, Command Line Arguments) |
| Algorithms | [Problem set 3](./pset3/) | Algorithms (Linear Search, Binary Search, Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Recursion, Merge Sort)|
| Memory | [Problem set 4](./pset4/) | C programming (Hexadecimal, Pointers, Structures, Dynamic Memory Allocation, Call Stacks, File Pointers) |
| Data Structures | [Problem set 5](./pset5/) |Data structures (Singly-Linked Lists, Hash Tables, Trees) |
| Python | [Problem set 6](./pset6/) | Programming in Python |
| SQL | [Problem set 7](./pset7/) | Programming in SQL|
| Specialization | [Problem set 8](./pset8/) | Game development and Web development|
| Game development| [Pong Game](./games50/pong) | 2D Pong game in Lua | 
| Game development | [Flappy birds game](./games50/flappy) | 2D Flappy birds game clone in Lua
| Web development | [Finance web app project](./finance/) | Stock trading Web app using Python, Flask, JavaScript, SQL, HTML and CSS |
